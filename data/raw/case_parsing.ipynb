Halbert, 52 Vt. 353 (1880)', 'See V.R.Cr.E 24(b). There is no exception from this requirement for statutory qualifications. Criminal Rule 24 also authorizes parties and their attorneys to examine prospective jurors prior to their selection. See id. 24(a). Moreover, we have adopted jury selection rules that require prospective jurors to complete a questionnaire on their qualifications for jury service. See Rules on Qualification, List, Selection and Summoning of All Jurors Rule 4(b) (1993). Our general policy is now that “[t]he right to challenge a juror is waived by a failure to object before the jury is impaneled if the basis for the objection is known or might, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered during voir dire.” In re Nash, 158 Vt. 458, 467, 614 A.2d 367, 372 (1991). Once the jury is impaneled, the law presumes the jury is beyond challenge. See Lattrell v. Swain, 127 Vt. 33, 37, 239 A.2d 195, 198 (1968)', 'See State v. Roy, 151 Vt. 17, 23, 557 A.2d 884, 888 (1989). Consistent with this policy, we have overruled past decisions that have recognized errors without preservation. See State v.

Forant, 168 Vt. 217, 220, 719 A.2d 399, 401 (1998)', 'See V.R.Cr.E 15(i). The civil rule requires that certain objections be made at the time of the deposition: objections to the form of questions or answers; and objections to any error “which might be obviated, removed, or cured if properly presented.” V.R.C.E 32(d)(3)(B). Especially as to answers defendant is now claiming are speculative or conclusory, we believe defendant had an obligation to make an objection, or motion to strike, at the time of the deposition to give the witness an opportunity to reframe the answer. See, e.g., Kirschner v. Broadhead, 671 F.2d 1034, 1038 (7th Cir. 1982) (objection that answer was unresponsive must be made at the deposition); Werre v.

Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure § 5039, at 200 (1977) (“true reason” appeal futile in these circumstances is that “there is no ruling of the trial judge to be reviewed”); see also State v. Zaccaro, 154 Vt. 83, 95, 574 A.2d 1256, 1263 (1990) (rejecting argument that trial court improperly “chilled” defendant’s right to confront witnesses in face of “strategic choice” not to introduce testimony that would have opened door to suppressed evidence).

See V.R.Cr.P.43(b); Bradley, 164 Vt. at 348-49, 670 A.2d at 813. Although we have never had occasion to decide whether a criminal defendant can waive the right to be present, personally or through counsel, when a trial judge interacts with deliberating jurors, we see no reason not to apply the general waiver rule. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 31 F.3d 469, 471-73 (7th Cir. 1994) (defendant has right to be present at private meeting between judge and jurors but right may be waived); Douglas v. State, 951 P.2d 651, 679 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997) (trial courts should obtain waivers in such circumstances to avoid error); State v. McMahon, 519 N.W.2d 621, 629 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994) (constitutional violation occurs when trial court makes comments to deliberating jury unless defendant waives right to be present); cf. People v.

Gorczyk, 81 F.3d 18 (2d Cir. 1996). If defendant claims he was not properly advised by counsel, or that counsel failed to follow his direction, his remedy, if any, lies in a post-conviction relief proceeding based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and not in a direct review of his conviction.

By its express terms, the maintenance supplement statute requires that the recipient of the supplement be “the custodial parent.” 15 V.S.A. § 661(a). In the same act, the Legislature defined the term “custodial parent,” specifically for the purposes of eligibility for a maintenance supplement: “The parent having custody for the greater period of time shall be considered the custodial parent for the purposes of section 661 of this title.” See 1985, No. 180 (Adj. Sess.), § 5 (codified as 15 V.S.A. § 657(a)). The Legislature thus clearly expressed its intent to limit the availability of maintenance supplement to the “parent having custody for the greater period of time.” Id. We are required to apply a statute according to its terms. See Carter v. Gugliuzzi, 168 Vt. 48, 53, 716 A.2d 17, 21 (1998) (“Where remedial legislation contains an express limitation, we have generally declined to expand the exception beyond its plain terms.”).

As the Swart Court found in examining the historical record, it does not uniformly point in one direction. Like many of the colonies, our early history shows that we were organized by religious people for whom religion was central to their social and political life. We accepted the Church of England as an established state religion. The original prohibitions on religious discrimination in the 1777 Constitution applied only to men who professed “the protestant religion.” Vermont Constitution of 1777, reprinted in Records of the Council of Censors of the State of Vermont 6 (E Gillies & D.

Shaeffer, A Comparison of the First Constitutions of Vermont and Pennsylvania in In a State of Nature: Readings in Vermont History 54,54 (H. Muller & S. Hand eds. 1982). Thus, Article I, § 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 provided that “no man ought or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any ministry, contrary to, or against, his own free will and consent.” See W Ball, The Religion Clauses of the Pennsylvania Constitution, 3 Widener J. Pub. L. 709,714 n.25 (1994). Pennsylvania evolved under the dominating influence of the Quakers and did not establish an official church. See T.

The school provision, Chapter II, § 68, has been amended twice, but the amendments occurred in 1954 and 1964, after the United States Supreme Court applied the religion provisions of the First Amendment to the states, see Cantwell v.

Nor is this a case where the amount of the subsidy is so small that it clearly covers only the cost of secular educational expenses. See Dunn v. Chicago Indus. Sch. for Girls, 117 N.E. 735, 737 (Ill. 1917) (payment to Roman Catholic industrial school on behalf of committed juvenile is constitutional since payment amount is below cost of food, clothing, medical care and training in useful arts and domestic science and only half of such costs in secular institution). Nor, as we emphasized above, is the issue that education occurs in a religious school, rather than the content of that education.

As expressed by the statute itself, the purpose underlying governmental regulation of the nursing profession is safeguarding the “life and health of the people of this state.” 26 V.S.A. § 1571.

Under the new statute, a shareholder of a Vermont corporation who dissents from certain enumerated corporate actions, including consummation of a plan of merger, is entitled to obtain from the corporation payment of the “fair value” of his or her shares. See 11A V.S.A. § 13.02(a)(1).

The prosecution offered circumstantial evidence to show that defendant shot Barrows, including the nature of the bullet wound which, while far from conclusive, indicated that suicide was improbable.

Furthermore, the State offered direct testimonial evidence that defendant admitted that he was “going to shoot someone” and confessed after Barrows’ death that he had “popped him.” Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and excluding defendant’s modifying evidence, the State’s case was sufficient to carry its burden under 13 V.S.A. § 2301, and withstand defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.

Likewise, when the family court invokes its authority to divide marital property and/or to award spousal maintenance, it is not taking or selling goods in execution, the statutory power conferred by § 2740 and subject to the exceptions enumerated therein. Wife contends that § 2740 is applicable if read in pari materia with the maintenance statute, 15 V.S.A. § 752, authorizing such relief when the court deems it necessary to meet the payee spouse’s “reasonable needs” or to maintain the payee’s predivorce standard-of-living.

Dailey, Inc., 161 Vt. 129, 141, 636 A.2d 744, 752 (1993) (upholding trial court’s discretionary denial of prejudgment interest). Since prejudgment interest may be awarded either as a matter of right or by discretion of the trial court, we first review whether the award of prejudgment interest here represents an abuse of discretion. For us to conclude the court abused its discretion, it must appear that the court entirely withheld its discretion or that it exercised discretion for “clearly untenable reasons or to a clearly untenable extent.” Vermont Nat’l Bank v. Clark, 156 Vt. 143, 145, 588 A.2d 621, 622 (1991)', 'See 158 Vt. 566, 571, 613 A.2d 1277, 1280 (1992)', 'See Foote, 158 Vt. 566, 613 A.2d 1277; Stacy v. Merchants Bank, 144 Vt. 515, 521-22, 482 A.2d 61, 64-65 (1984). We have never suggested, however, that promissory estoppel damages are coextensive with full contractual remedies. See 3 E.

This is particularly so in a case such as the one at bar where prejudgment interest is awarded on an undifferentiated, lump-sum verdict for a promissory estoppel claim.

In Johnson, we discussed the changeover in homicide terminology from “malice aforethought” to specific states of willfulness for each type of murder, and, because the term “malice” created a potential source of confusion for jurors, we indicated trial courts should no longer use the word in their jury instructions. See 158 Vt. at 515-19, 615 A.2d at 136-38. Our one recent, brief discussion of “intent to Wll” in voluntary manslaughter noted the effect this changeover in terminology had on the description of the offense. See State v.

Consequently, we went on to clarify that either recklessness or criminal negligence, as defined by the Model Penal Code (MPC), satisfies the state of mind for involuntary manslaughter.

But. . . they might be of the intent-to-do-seriously-bodily-injury, or of the depraved-heart, types.”).

Thus, in 1989 taxpayers reported and paid taxes on 48.23% of IDX’s net income — allocable to Mr. Tarrant as a shareholder — as personal income for federal and Vermont tax purposes.

We agree with the trial court that by February 1994 plaintiff had more than sufficient information to alert him that a dram shop cause of action against Valley’s might be available to him. Plaintiff had seen the State’s information charging Langmaid with careless and negligent operation by driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Further, he knew that a police investigation had concluded that Langmaid had been drinking at Valley’s the evening of the accident. Although at that point he could not be sure that Langmaid had been overserved at Valley’s that night, he knew that he would have access to a police report providing more details of the circumstances surrounding the accident. As it turned out, the report, which was available from the Department of Motor Vehicles in June 1994, strongly suggested that Langmaid was indeed overserved intoxicating liquor at Valley’s the evening of the accident. According to plaintiff, as far as he knew in February 1994 Langmaid may have had only one drink at Valley’s and then had several more in his car before driving off. Such a scenario could not have been ruled out at that time, but the information plaintiff was aware of even in February 1994 presented far more than a “remote possibility” that Valley’s had overserved Langmaid. See Byers v. Burleson, 713 F.2d 856, 861 (D.C. Cir. 1983)', 'See Ware, 664 F. Supp. at 171 (generally determination of when plaintiff actually discovered or reasonably should have discovered injury is factual determination for jury, but summary judgment may be granted to defendant if there is no material factual dispute and no reasonable factfinder could differ in finding for defendant); Morris v. Geer, 720 P.2d 994, 997 (Colo. Ct. App. 1986)', 'See Estate of Chappelle v. Sanders, 442 A.2d 157, 158 (D.C. 1982)']\n",
      "104 ['f also argues that even if the limitations period began to run in February 1994, it was tolled as the result of Rene Valley’s fraudulent concealment of defendants’ tortious conduct. In making this argument, plaintiff points to evidence indicating, among other things, that Valley told the bartender who had served Langmaid the evening of the accident not to speak to plaintiff or his attorney and to tell the business’s insurance adjuster that she had served Langmaid only two drinks. We conclude that the trial court properly rejected this argument. Under 12 VS.A. § 555, a limitations period may be tolled when “a person entitled to bring a personal action is prevented from so doing by the fraudulent concealment of the cause of such action by the person against whom it lies.” In this case, any fraudulent concealment on the part of Rene Valley did not prevent plaintiff from bringing his dram shop action within the limitations period. We have already concluded that plaintiff knew enough in February 1994 for the two-year limitations period to commence. See Estate of Chappelle v. Sanders, 442 A.2d 157, 158 (D.C. 1982)']\n",

[sjhall not be moved, enlarged, altered or extended in any manner that would make the non-conforming structure more non-conforming.” We believe that the switch between the terms “non-complying structure” and “non-conforming structure” represents a drafting imprecision, but not a change of meaning. Landowner’s argument to the contrary would leave the defined term “non-complying structure” without use in the regulatory language, and the term used to define the regulatory policy, “non-conforming structure,” without a definition.

The best interests of the child remains the paramount consideration.

To challenge a criminal conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) defense counsel’s performance fell below the prevailing standard of competency, and (2) that this performance prejudiced his defense. See Trombly, 160 Vt. at 217-18, 627 A.2d at 856; State v. Bristol, 159 Vt. 334, 337, 618 A.2d 1290, 1291-92 (1992). To demonstrate prejudice, “defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. If counsel’s performance is found to have been competent, the court need not determine whether defendant suffered prejudice. See id. at 697.

An identically situated party who did not raise the supplement issue during the divorce action would be permitted to seek a maintenance supplement with no showing of changed circumstances. See 15 V.S.A. § 661(a). Mother’s interpretation creates an incentive to forego requesting a maintenance supplement until sometime after the divorce and child support orders are issued thereby delaying fair and final resolution of the issues. This Court construes statutes to avoid absurd results manifestly unintended by the Legislature. See In re Cottrell, 158 Vt. 500, 504, 614 A.2d 381, 383 (1992)', 'See Viskup v.

First and foremost, we reject the contention that the Legislature intended to preclude altogether the establishment of a maintenance supplement post-divorce, as father’s construction of § 661 would require. The purpose of § 661, by its clear language, is “to correct any disparity in the financial circumstances of the parties if the court finds that the disparity has resulted or will result in a lower standard of living for the child than the child would have if living with the noncustodial parent.” 15 V.S.A. § 661(a). Despite the ambiguous reference to “maintenance” in the provision’s title, the statute clearly serves the purpose of safeguarding children’s — instead of parents’ — interests, and therefore may be viewed as a component of child support generally. We held in Viskup that the Legislature intended to allow parents to seek establishment of child support post-divorce, even though the parent had not made the request at the time of the original adjudication of divorce and child custody.

Thus, where evidence proffered by a defendant is irrelevant to the case being tried, it may be properly excluded. See V.R.E. 402. Where evidence is relevant, it may nonetheless be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or other considerations. See V.R.E. 403; State v. Larose, 150 Vt. 363, 368, 554 A.2d 227, 231 (1988). Evidence of the character of a witness is admissible only to the extent it is relevant to the credibility of that witness.

Even then, the witness’s character for veracity or duplicity may be supported or impeached only in the form of opinion or reputation. See V.R.E. 608(a). Specific instances of conduct of a witness may be referenced only through cross-examination of the witness, and may not be introduced by extrinsic evidence. See V.R.E. 608(b), Reporter’s Notes (rule prevents cross-examination of prejudicial or unnecessarily embarrassing scope). Resolving evidentiary questions where evidence is admissible for one purpose but excludable for another is given to the discretion of the trial court. See State v.

Where a jury is convinced that a defendant has committed some crime, but is not fully convinced the defendant is guilty of the charged offense, instruction on a lesser-included offense “ensures that the jury will accord the defendant the full benefit of the reasonable-doubt standard.” Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 634 (1980)', 'See Geiger, 674 P.2d at 1307 (‘“defendant has no legitimate interest in compelling the jury to adopt an all or nothing approach to the issue of guilt.

Under the statutory scheme for sentencing an individual convicted of murder, the court is to consider aggravating and mitigating factors as specifically set forth in the statute, see 13 V.S.A. § 2303(d)(l)-(7), (e)(l)-(6), or as suggested by the parties, see id. § 2303(d)(8), (e)(7).

As noted, both SRS interviews with the children were tape recorded and transcribed. Having reviewed both tapes, the trial court found that they demonstrated ample indicia of reliability. We agree. Neither of the SRS interviewers had been informed of the details of the alleged abuse prior to the interviews, so neither was seeking to confirm any preconceived ideas of what the children should be disclosing. The childrens’ statements were fresh, having occurred the day after their initial disclosures. Each child stated that defendant had put his “peepee” in her mouth, and S.J. provided additional details about the assault. Each child provided accurate information concerning peripheral details, such as defendant’s appearance and clothing on the date of the incident, the interior of the house, Lucy LaBounty’s activities on the day in question, and the rooms where the abuse allegedly occurred. The timing and conduct of the interviews, and the overall consistency and detail of the childrens’ statements, thus support the trial court’s finding of trustworthiness. See State v.

In this case the trooper was not asking defendant again if he wished to waive his Miranda rights, but was making a wholly different inquiry regarding defendant’s right to counsel under the implied consent statute.

See id. at 98-99, 475 A.2d at 1052 (where defendant committed repeated sexual assaults upon a single victim over a period of one and a half hours, State was not required to elect single act upon which to base conviction). Moreover, we have observed that “[n]o election is required where a single criminal act is involved and the proof shows its commission in different modes and by different means.” State v. Coomer, 105 Vt. 175, 178-79, 163 A. 585, 587 (1933)', 'See 1 W LaFave and A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 3.2(e), at 32 n.42.1 (Supp. 1998) (crime of possession not an act, but a continuing offense, lasting as long as the act of possession does). The offense is committed when a defendant engages in particular conduct, rather than a specific act or acts. See United States v. Jones, 533 F.2d 1387, 1391 (6th Cir. 1976) (“Possession is a course of conduct, not an act . . . .”); Johnson v. Morgenthau, 505 N.E.2d 240, 242-43 (N.Y. 1987)', 'See State v. Benneig, 146 Vt. 391, 393-94, 505 A.2d 1192, 1194 (1985) (constructive possession is when “[a] person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention. . . at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing”). The two caches of marijuana introduced at trial both tended to show defendant’s commission of a single, continuing offense, not multiple acts. The State was not required to elect an individual cache on which to base its case, nor was the district court required to instruct the jury to premise guilt of constructive possession on a single cache. See State v. Groves, 477 N.W2d 789, 800 (Neb. 1991) (State not required to elect which of three guns could provide basis for guilt in weapons possession charge); State v. Love, 908 P.2d 395, 398 (Wash. Ct. App. 1996)', 'See State v. Francis, 151 Vt. 296, 301, 561 A.2d 392, 395 (1989)', 'See Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965); State v. Norton, 134 Vt. 100, 105, 353 A.2d 324, 327 (1976); 13 V.S.A. § 6601. Comment is improper when it is “‘manifestly intended to be. . . [and is] of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.’” Norton, 134 Vt. at 106, 353 A.2d at 327 (quoting United States ex rel Leak v. Follette, 418 F.2d 1266, 1269 (2d Cir. 1969)). Remarks \"will not constitute reversible error unless the defendant makes a showing of resulting prejudice. See State v. Powers, 163 Vt. 98, 103, 655 A.2d 712, 715 (1994)', 'See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963)', 'See State v. Ladabouche, 146 Vt. 279, 281, 502 A.2d 852, 854 (1985). Similarly, in closing arguments, prosecuting counsel may not make inflammatory statements, depart from the evidence presented at trial, or inject counsel’s personal beliefs as to the guilt of the accused. See State v. Riva, 145 Vt. 15, 20, 481 A.2d 1060, 1063 (1984). Here, defendant’s right to a fair trial was not compromised. The State said in rebuttal that “there is no evidence in this ease that Tom Sweet possessed marijuana.” (Emphasis added). So stated, the comment was true because no evidence had been introduced to suggest that Sweet had possessed the marijuana. Defendant himself had stated to the police when they searched his home that the marijuana did not belong to his roommates, and at the suppression hearing he stated that “Tom Sweet never smoked pot in the house.” Thus defendant’s contention that the State contradicted exculpatory evidence, or departed from the evidence, fails. Moreover, the fact that Sweet had been charged with possession of marijuana would not exculpate defendant. The trial court instructed the jury that a person can be found guilty of constructive possession even if he possessed the marijuana jointly with another person. Thus there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have returned a different verdict even had it known Sweet had been charged. See State v. Gibbons, 146 Vt. 342, 344, 503 A.2d 540, 541 (1985)', 'See State v. Hughes, 158 Vt. 398, 401, 610 A.2d 559, 561 (1992)']\n",

Mideast Sys., Ltd., 111 F.R.D. 359, 361 (D.D.C. 1986).

Our ruling is only that 12 VS.A. § 4601 is applicable to enforcement of judgment liens because it is incorporated by reference; its application to mortgage foreclosure is unaffected. Nor are we persuaded that the Legislature may have decided to exempt appeals of judgment lien enforcement actions from the permission requirement because they raise complicated questions of the application of the homestead exemption. The Legislature never referenced the homestead exemption in the judgment lien law, see Mercier, 149 Vt. at 527, 546 A.2d at 790, and judgment liens apply to all real property, of which homesteads are only a part. In any event, we do not agree that mortgage foreclosure cases are less complicated than judgment lien enforcement actions or that the policy behind the permission requirement is related to the complexity of the action. Indeed, the absence of a reason why the Legislature would distinguish a judgment lien foreclosure action from a mortgage foreclosure action for purposes of the appeal permission requirement weighs against defendant’s interpretation of the statute.

The State presented evidence indicating that the old trail did not provide access to the Walker lands, and the court found this evidence credible. Accordingly, the court concluded that Walker did not have an easement over Okemo Mountain Road when he attempted to reserve one in the 1935 deed. Because the trial court is in a unique position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and weigh the evidence, we will uphold its findings unless clearly erroneous. See Kanaan v.

The general rule is that an owner of property abutting a public road has both the right to use the road in common with other members of the public and a private right for the purpose of access.

The right of access has two requirements: (1) the person claiming the right must own land that abuts the road, and (2) the road must be a public road. See Spurling v. Kansas State Park & Resources Auth., 636 P.2d 182, 183 (Kan. Ct.

At least with respect to the Vermont Agency of Transportation, which controls the bulk of state roads in Vermont, the Legislature has explicitly recognized that its activities may give rise to inverse condemnation actions and has provided that the plaintiff in such an action may recover costs, including attorney, appraisal and engineering fees, in addition to damages.

Violation of Rule 26(g) was not, however, specifically alleged or noticed by Attorney Taylor or the court, although the latter did consider its applicability at the hearing. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that appellant was prejudiced by the omission. Both Rule 11 and Rule 26 treat signed papers as certifying that the pleading is not offered for any improper purpose, such as to harass, that the claims and contentions therein have a basis in existing law, and that the contentions have evidentiary support. Thus, actions that violate Rule 11(b) also violate the provisions of Rule 26(g), and sanctions imposed pursuant to either rule are reviewed under identical abuse of discretion standards'. See, e.g., In re Byrd, Inc., 927 F.2d 1135, 1137 (10th Cir. 1991) (courts apply Rule 11 standards and case law to Rule 26(g)); Apex Oil Co. v.

At the same time, however, a number of courts have held that the imposition of such noncompensatory fines for abuse of the discovery process are punitive in nature and therefore require .enhanced due process protections, including specific notice of the possibility of nonremedial sanctions, the opportunity to respond to such fines, and other procedural safeguards.

The introduction of the juvenile adjudication in that ease was necessary because there was no other way for the defendant to prove his theory that the witness’s juvenile adjudication made him vulnerable to police pressure. See id. at 318. By contrast, defendant here is attempting to utilize the juvenile adjudication to prove the victim is an untruthful person and nothing more. Defendant argues, essentially, that forgery represents a more serious misrepresentation than the other lies told by the victim, and therefore the evidence was necessary to prove that the victim was totally unbelievable.

Comment 2(a) to § 221.2 states that the knowledge requirement excludes from criminal liability both the inadvertent trespasser and the trespasser who believes that he has received express or implied permission to enter or remain on the premises. The knowledge requirement establishes a subjective standard. See State v. Sargent, 156 Vt. 463, 466-67, 594 A.2d 401, 403 (1991); Model Penal Code § 2.02(b)© & Cmt. 2 (1980). It is not sufficient for the State to show that defendant should have known he was not licensed or privileged to enter the dwelling. See Sargent, 156 Vt. at 465-66, 594 A.2d at 402.

Viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, the evidence showed that the Retreat had a very loose attitude toward the private use of Retreat resources by its employees, including those employees in supervisory and managerial positions. Although plaintiff was given a written warning about using Retreat resources for his private work on Dr. Beach’s house during Retreat hours, there was evidence that (1) Dr. Beach declined to accept Sarle’s recommendation that the Retreat place plaintiff on probation and cut its ties to plaintiff’s trucking company; (2) after plaintiff went to see Sarle about the warning he received, Sarle told plaintiff that working for Dr. Beach was a “ticklish” situation and that plaintiff would have to use his best judgment to resolve the situation; (3) at least one supervisor utilized Retreat equipment and personnel during Retreat time after Sarle warned plaintiff about misuse of Retreat resources; and (4) the Retreat did not have a specific written policy on misuse of Retreat resources until two weeks before plaintiff was fired in November 1988. Further, plaintiff presented evidence that challenged, at least in some respect, all of the incidents of plaintiff’s alleged misuse of Retreat resources related in Johnson’s testimony. Upon review of the record, we conclude that the jury could have reasonably determined, in light of the above evidence, that plaintiff’s actions did not constitute serious misconduct, and that plaintiff was not given fair notice that his actions could result in termination without further warnings.

In ruling on a subdivision request, the planning commission may require, that the subdivided plots “at least comply with the requirements [of the zoning ordinance].” 24 V.S.A. § 4417(2).

Massachusetts has adopted the Kotteakos standard. See Commonwealth v. Flebotte, 630 N.E.2d 265, 268 (Mass. 1994). Of the remaining states, the Rhode Island standard is similar to that in New Hampshire, see State v. Dinagen, 639 A.2d 1353, 1357 (R.I. 1994) (nonconstitutional error, is harmless if ‘“it is not reasonably possible that such evidence would influence an average jury on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence’ ”) (quoting State v. Bowden, 439 A.2d 263, 269 (R.I. 1982)), and the Connecticut standard appears similar to that in Massachusetts. See State v. Sauris, 631 A.2d 238, 252 (Conn. 1993) (harmless error if defendant cannot show “‘that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result’”) (quoting State v. Payne, 591 A.2d 1246, 1252 (Conn. 1991)). The Maine standard appears to fall somewhere in between. See State v. Shortsleeves, 580 A.2d 145, 148 (Me. 1990)', 'See Commonwealth v. Story, 383 A.2d 155, 163 (Pa. 1978) (source of error is irrelevant in determining whether error is prejudicial to accused); Saltzburg, The Harm of Harmless Error, 59 Va. L. Rev. 988, 1025 (1973) (“[I]t is erroneous to say that constitutional errors are more likely to have an injurious effect at trial than other errors.”). Indeed, the effect of adopting different rules for constitutional and nonconstitutional errors is to require us to engage in an unnecessary inquiry into whether the error is constitutionally based. This inquiry is particularly required for evidentiary issues because they almost always have a constitutional dimension. See State v. Cartee, 161 Vt. 73, 77, 632 A.2d 1108, 1111 (1993) (limits on cross-examination imposed by trial court under V.R.E. 403 analyzed as confrontation clause issue, and Chapman standard used to determine whether error was harmless); State v.

We note in this regard that the New England states that have adopted the Kotteakos standard for nonconstitutional errors have required the Chapman standard for state constitutional errors, further blurring the distinction. See State v. Oquendo, 613 A.2d 1300, 1314 (Conn. 1992); Commonwealth v. Rios, 588 N.E.2d 6, 9 (Mass. 1992)', 'See Delaware v.

Thus, we believe application of the Chapman standard will lead to the most predictable results in an area where appellate analysis is often criticized as result-oriented. See, e.g., Allen, A Serendipitous Trek Through the Advance-Sheet Jungle: Criminal Justice in the Courts of Review, 70 Iowa L. Rev. 311, 332 (1985)', 'See State v.

Clearly, the first of these elements, duty, is central to a negligence claim, and its existence is primarily a question of law. Denis Bail Bonds, Inc. v. State, 159 Vt. 481, 487, 622 A.2d 495, 499 (1993). The imposition of a duty is “‘an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.’” Id. (quoting W Prosser & W Keeton, The Law of Torts § 53, at 358 (5th ed. 1984)', 'See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A(3) (1965)', 'See Langle, 146 Vt. at 519-20, 510 A.2d at 1304-05. These factors may include the degree of certainty that plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff’s injury, the moral blame attached to defendant’s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the burden to the defendant, the consequences to the community of finding a duty, and the availability and cost of insurance. Id. We think that an additional factor is more significant here — that is, that plaintiff seeks a duty to prevent purely economic loss. Negligence law does not generally recognize a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid intangible economic loss to another unless one’s conduct has inflicted some accompanying physical harm. See Prosser & Keeton, supra, § 92, at 657; Breslauer v. Fayston School Dist., 163 Vt. 416, 421, 659 A.2d 1129, 1132 (1995)', 'See Edwards v. Louisville Ladder Co., 796 F. Supp. 966, 969 (WD.

The immunity of a municipality, however, is not unlimited. Traditionally, courts have held municipalities liable only where the negligent act arises out of a duty that is proprietary in nature as opposed to governmental. The rationale for this is that municipalities perform governmental responsibilities for the general public as instrumentalities of the state; they conduct proprietary activities only for the benefit of the municipality and its residents. See Marshall v. Town of Brattleboro, 121 Vt. 417, 422, 160 A.2d 762, 765 (1960). This Court has applied the governmental/proprietary distinction for decades.

Thus, the New York Court of Appeals held in an early case that “[wjhether a person is liable for injuries arising from the erection of a fence depends upon the ordinary principles . . . as to what constitutes negligence.” Barr, 104 N.E. at 620. In Barr, the defendant erected a barbed-wire fence between his property and an adjoining schoolyard. An eleven-year-old girl inadvertently ran into the fence, from which she received lacerations on her neck. The court reversed summary judgment, holding that the defendant could be held liable for negligence in erecting the fence. See id.; see also Marton v. Jones, 186 P. 410, 411 (Cal. Ct. App. 1919) (negligence of defendant in maintaining barbed-wire fence next to sidewalk gives rise to liability to pedestrian who slipped on sidewalk and grabbed fence); Skaling v.

The no-contact rule is meant to protect the client against overreaching, not the disclosure of prejudicial facts. See Niesig v.

In Mompoint, the plaintiff, who brought an employment discrimination suit against the defendant, claimed that the defendant’s asserted reason for the plaintiff’s termination — that the plaintiff sexually harassed female employees — was pretextual. See id. at 415. Although the female employees’ statements were likely to be admissible against the employer, the court found that employer’s need to have counsel present was minimal because the employer would probably have its own records of the alleged harassment. See id. at 418-19. On the other hand, the plaintiff’s lawyer would have difficulty gathering evidence and assessing the strength of the plaintiff’s case without free and open discussion with the female employees. See id. at 419. The court therefore allowed the plaintiff’s lawyer to interview the female employees out of the presence of the defendant’s counsel. See id.; see also Curley v.

       "     'text': \"Johnson, J.\\nThis case concerns a dispute among the parties and their insurers over the allocation of costs for the cleanup of a series of gasoline leaks. The superior court ruled that Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty) was responsible for approximately 92% of the costs, that the Continental/Glens Falls Insurance Company (Continental) was responsible for the balance, and that Liberty’s counterclaim against the State of Vermont for contribution was without merit. Liberty appeals, contending the court erred in: (1) dismissing its counterclaim against the State; (2) making certain findings concerning the amount of petroleum released and the allocation of remediation costs among the parties; (3) ordering a setoff against Liberty’s restitution award from Continental; and (4) declining to award prejudgment interest. Continental has cross-appealed, contending the court erred in rejecting its defenses of waiver, unclean hands, and laches against Liberty’s cross-claim for restitution. We reverse and remand on the issue of prejudgment interest, and otherwise affirm.\\nFACTS\\nAs found by the trial court, the facts were as follows. In 1983, gasoline began to leak from underground storage tanks at Spillane’s Service Center on Route 7 in Shelburne, a site owned by Tamarack Services of South Burlington. The leak was discovered in 1985, and shortly thereafter the State ordered corrective action.\\nThe volume of the release was large. Free-product gasoline spread thoughout the site and migrated to adjacent properties. Liberty, Tamarack’s insurer at the time of the leak, was notified of the release and accepted responsibility for payment of the costs of remediation. Tamarack hired Ground Water Technologies, Inc. (GTI) to monitor contamination levels and perform the cleanup.\\nLiberty’s policy expired in August 1986, at which time Continental became the insurer. Continental’s policy, which was renewed in 1987 and 1988, contained several pollution exclusion endorsements. Liberty continued to pay the costs of remediation through this period.\\nIn November 1987, GTI discovered a second release of gasoline at the site consisting of several leaking fuel lines. These were repaired by January 1988. During the summer of 1989, more leaks occurred. The parties presented a variety of expert evidence and opinion at trial relating to the rate, duration, and overall volume of the three releases. The court found that the initial release, which Continental’s expert had characterized as “massive,” consisted of 11,000 gallons. The court found that the second and third releases, which were much smaller and were discovered relatively quickly through GTI’s previously installed monitoring equipment, each consisted of 450 gallons.\\nTamarack made no claims under its policies with Continental at the time of the second and third releases, believing that the pollution exclusion clauses precluded coverage. Liberty received actual notice of the third release no later than September 1989, and continued to pay remediation costs until 1990, when it requested that GTI provide an estimate of the remediation costs attributable to releases other than the first release. GTI estimated that approximately $89,291 of the $1,103,587 expended to date could be attributed to the later releases.\\nIn September 1990, Liberty suspended payments pending negotations with Tamarack and the State regarding allocation of remediation costs. In October, an agreement was reached in which Tamarack agreed to apply to the State’s petroleum cleanup fund under 10 V.S.A. § 1941, which authorizes the Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources to disburse funds for “uninsured costs” of cleanup and restoration of contaminated soil caused by releases of petroleum from underground storage tanks. 10 V.S.A. § 1941(b). Tamarack represented that it was uninsured for the costs of remediating the 1987 and 1989 releases because of the pollution exclusion clauses in its policies with Continental. Following the authorization of payments from the cleanup fund, Liberty agreed to split the costs of future remediation with the State, and the State agreed to pay 50% of past expenses it determined to be reasonable. Negotiations were not successful over what past costs were reasonable.\\nLater, the State discovered evidence that the pollution exclusion clauses in the Continental policies were invalid because Continental had not obtained timely approval of the clauses from the Department of Insurance. The State thereupon commenced this litigation by filing a complaint against Tamarack, Continental, and Liberty to declare Continental liable under its policies for the 1987 and 1989 releases and to recover the remediation costs paid by the State. Liberty filed a counterclaim against the State on the theory that the State was obligated under the agreement to pay for past expenses allocable to the 1987 and 1989 releases. As the subrogee of Tamarack’s rights, Liberty also filed a cross-claim against Continental, seeking reimbursement of past expenses allocable to the 1987 and 1989 releases. Continental asserted certain affirmative defenses against Liberty’s cross-claim, and filed a cross-claim against Liberty alleging various causes of action.\\nContinental subsequently entered into a settlement agreement with Tamarack and the State, in which it agreed to pay $150,000 for past remediation expenses, and to assume responsibility for the State’s half of future remediation costs. Continental reserved its right to seek monetary or injunctive relief against Liberty.\\nThe trial court subsequently granted partial summary judgment in favor of the State, ruling that the pollution exclusion clauses in the Continental insurance policies were invalid and that insurance coverage was therefore available to Tamarack under those policies for the cost of remediating the 1987 and 1989 releases. Later, the court granted the State’s motion to dismiss Liberty’s counterclaim, ruling that the Secretary was authorized to approve expenditures from the fund only for uninsured cleanup costs.\\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court issued a lengthy written decision, which it subsequently amended, containing extensive and detailed factual findings and conclusions. The court found that there was a “linear relationship” between the total volume of petroleum spilled during the several releases and the total cost of remediation incurred by Liberty and Continental, and calculated the parties’ proportional share of liability based upon the percentage of the total spill (11,900 gallons) attributable to the initial release (11,000 gallons) and subsequent releases (900 gallons). In this fashion, the court determined that 7.563% of past and future remediation costs was Continental’s responsibility and 92.437% was Liberty’s responsibility. Applying these percentages to the total costs of remediation ($2,505,964), the court found that Liberty was entitled to restitution from Continental in the amount of $189,526.05. Having previously paid $189,718.01 toward remediation of the site, Continental was entitled to a credit and refund of $191.96 from Liberty. The court ruled against Continental on its cross-claim against Liberty. This appeal followed.\\nDISCUSSION\\nCounterclaim Against State\\nLiberty contends the court erred in dismissing its counterclaim against the State for enforcement of the State’s agreement to pay 50% of the reasonable remediation costs paid by Liberty between November 1987 and December 31, 1990.\\n*\\nLiberty also contends the court’s order requiring Liberty and Continental to split the future costs of remediation conflicted with Liberty’s agreement with the State.\\nThe statute authorizing state expenditures for petroleum cleanup is clear and unambiguous. The Secretary may authorize such expenditures only for “uninsured costs” of pollution cleanup. 10 V.S.A. § 1941(b). The agreement with Liberty to expend state funds was plainly premised upon the representation and understanding that Tamarack was uninsured for the 1987 and 1989 releases, an understanding that later proved to be unfounded. Thus, the court correctly concluded that there was no authority for the State’s expenditure of cleanup funds in this case, and properly dismissed Liberty’s counterclaim.\\nLiberty contends, nevertheless, that Tamarack was somehow uninsured at the time the State authorized the expenditures, and only later became insured when the court ruled that Continental’s pollution-exclusion clauses were invalid. The court’s judgment did not create the insurance coverage, however, but merely declared the existence of coverage under the policies. See 12 V.S.A. § 4711 (courts have power “to declare rights, status and other legal relations”); Robtoy v. City of St. Albans, 132 Vt. 503, 504, 321 A.2d 45, 46 (1974) (function of declaratory judgment is to provide declaration of rights, status and other legal relations). The order dismissing Liberty’s counterclaim against the State, and the order requiring Liberty and Continental to split the future costs of remediation, were therefore proper.\\nSufficiency of the Evidence\\nLiberty next contends the evidence failed to support the court’s findings concerning the volume of the petroleum releases, the total cost of remediation of the Tamarack site, the restitution percentages attributable to Liberty and Continental, and the calculation of the restitution award.\\nThe standard of review is well settled. We will not set aside a trial court’s findings unless clearly erroneous, nor disturb its conclusions if they are reasonably supported by the findings. See Morgan v. Kroupa, 167 Vt. 99, 104, 702 A.2d 630, 633 (1997). Findings are viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, disregarding modifying evidence, and will not be disturbed merely because they are contradicted by substantial evidence; rather, an appellant must show that there is no credible evidence to support the finding. See Bianchi v. Lorenz, 166 Vt. 555, 562, 701 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1997).\\nLiberty contends the evidence failed to support the court’s finding that the volume of the initial 1985 release of petroleum was 11,000 gallons. Continental’s expert testified that the first release was “massive,” and using a variety of methodologies calculated that the volume ranged variously from seven to twenty-seven thousand gallons, “in the tens of thousands of gallons,” “something over 11,000 gallons,” and “10,000 gallons or greater.” These estimates were based, in part, upon evidence indicating both the daily rate of leakage, and the duration of the leak. Credible evidence thus supported the court’s decision to fix the volume at a relatively conservative 11,000 gallons.\\nLiberty further contends the evidence failed to support the court’s finding that the volume of the 1987 release was 450 gallons. The record, however, contains a GTI report, prepared at Liberty’s request, calculating that the second release was between 300 and 600 gallons. The court’s decision to fix the volume at the mid-point was not unreasonable. Although Liberty contends the report’s author was not qualified as an expert, Liberty raised no objection to the report on this or any other ground at trial. Accordingly, the claim is waived on appeal. See State v. Fisher, 167 Vt. 36, 43, 702 A.2d 41, 45-46 (1997) (failure to raise objection at trial waives claim of error on appeal). Liberty also argues that the estimate of 300 to 600 gallons in the GTI report referred to a different release of petroleum, but testimony at trial refuted the contention. The evidence thus supported the finding.\\nLiberty next challenges the court’s finding that the volume of the 1989 release was 450 gallons, asserting that evidence relating to the rate and duration of leakage required a finding of at least 1560 gallons. There was evidence, however, indicating that the third release consisted of three separate leaks of approximately one gallon per day, between April and August of 1989, yielding a total volume of approximately 450 gallons. The fact that there was conflicting evidence does not render the court’s finding unreasonable or clearly erroneous. See Bianchi, 166 Vt. at 562, 701 A.2d at 1041.\\nFinally, the record contains ample evidence to support the court’s finding that the total cost of remediation, including the amounts paid by Liberty and Continental, was $2,505,964.\\nAllocation of Costs and Restitution\\nLiberty next takes issue with the court’s allocation of proportional responsibility for the costs of remediation, which resulted in a finding that Liberty was hable for 92.437% of the costs of remediation, and Continental was responsible for 7.563%. As noted, the liability percentages derived by the court were based upon the respective percentages of the total release of petroleum attributable to the initial and subsequent petroleum releases. The court’s calculations flowed logically from its reasoning and findings, which were based in turn upon credible evidence; they cannot, therefore, be disturbed. See id. Nor did the court clearly err, as Liberty contends, in failing to make a separate restitution award of $39,291.50 based upon GTI’s estimate of the costs attributable to the 1987 and 1989 releases which Liberty paid prior to 1991. The trial court, as noted, found that Liberty was entitled to a total restitution award of $189,526, which plainly included the $39,291 in costs calculated by GTI. There was no error.\\nLiberty also contends the court erred in ordering that the $189,718 paid by Continental toward remediation of the site, pursuant to its settlement with the State, be set off against Liberty’s restitution award of $189,526. The setoff, however, was entirely consistent with the court’s finding concerning the respective liabilities of Liberty and Continental. The fact that the court rejected Continental’s cross-claims against Liberty did not undermine the court’s broad authority to award the setoff. See Jensvold v. Town & Country Motors, Inc., 162 Vt. 580, 584, 649 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1994) (court has broad discretion to award setoff under general equitable principles). Moreover, in its settlement with the State, Continental expressly reserved its right to seek reimbursement from Liberty. Accordingly, we find no error.\\nDiscovery Sanction\\nContinental moved for sanctions against Liberty for failing to produce documents that Continental had requested concerning Liberty’s settlement of third-party claims against Tamarack for a total of $396,692. Following a hearing, the court granted the motion, ruling that Liberty would be precluded from introducing evidence relating to its cross-claim against Continental for restitution of ’the monies paid in settlement of the third-party claims.\\nLiberty’s argument on this point is brief, and consists of the assertion that there is “nothing in the record to suggest that Liberty violated any rules relating to discovery,” and hence no basis for the sanction. The record shows that following an evidentiary hearing and extensive argument, the court concluded that Liberty had failed to respond adequately to Continental’s request for the files relating to the dozen or more third-party claims against Tamarack. In September 1993, and again in October 1995, Continental had requested copies of the complaints and settlement agreements. Continental sought the documents in connection with Liberty’s claim for reimbursement of the costs of settlement associated with the second and third releases. Liberty provided none of the requested documents until trial in March 1997, when it produced one of the files that it claimed to have just discovered. Liberty’s counsel asserted that it had been unable to locate the balance. The court concluded that Liberty had not adequately complied with the request, and that Continental could not properly defend the claim for reimbursument of the settlement costs without the requested documents. As the court succinctly explained: “ [W]hat I’m going to do is not. receive in evidence the third-party claims. . . . [Continental/Glens Falls] have to see the settlement agreements. They asked for them, they’re entitled to them, and they should have them.”\\nContrary to Liberty’s claim, the record amply supports the court’s ruling. Based on the evidence, the court was entitled to find that Liberty had not been forthcoming in responding to the discovery request, and in concluding that Continental had been severely prejudiced as a result. See Bianchi, 166 Vt. at 562, 701 A.2d at 1041 (findings must be upheld if supported by any credible evidence); see also Refac Int’l, Ltd. v. Hitachi, Ltd., 921 F.2d 1247, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (extent of party’s noncompliance with discovery request supported implicit finding of willful failure to comply). We cannot say that the court’s sanction, in these circumstances, constituted a patent abuse of discretion. See White Current Corp. v. Vermont Elec. Coop., 158 Vt. 216, 223, 609 A.2d 222, 226 (1992) (absent abuse of discretion, trial court’s imposition of discovery sanctions will not be disturbed). Accordingly, the court’s ruling must be upheld.\\nLiberty raises the additional claim in its reply brief that the discovery sanction was not predicated upon a specific order compelling production under V.R.C.E 37(b)(2). Liberty did not raise this argument at trial, or in its opening brief, and therefore has waived the claim on appeal. See Long v. L'Esperance, 166 Vt. 566, 570 n.4, 701 A.2d 1048, 1052 n.4 (1997) (preservation at trial); Secretary v. Earth Constr., Inc., 165 Vt. 160, 165, 676 A.2d 769, 773 (1996) (preservation in appellant’s original brief).\\nPrejudgment Interest\\nThe court initially awarded prejudgment interest on Liberty’s restitution award, but reversed itself in response to Continental’s motion for reconsideration, concluding that prejudgment interest was unavailable because the amount of damages was in dispute and the subject of conflicting expert testimony. We have explained the rule on prejudgment interest as follows: “Prejudgment interest may be awarded as damages for detention of money due for breach or default. This interest is awarded as of right when the principal sum recovered is liquidated or capable of ready ascertainment and may be awarded in the court’s discretion for other forms of damage.” Newport Sand & Gravel Co. v. Miller Concrete Constr., Inc., 159 Vt. 66, 71, 614 A.2d 395, 398 (1992).\\nThe principal rationale for an award of prejudment interest as of right is that, where damages are liquidated or determinable by a reasonably certain standard of measurement, “the defendant can avoid the accrual of interest by simply tendering to the plaintiff a sum equal to the amount of damages.” Johnson v. Pearson Agri-Sys., Inc., 350 N.W.2d 127, 130 (Wis. 1984). The fact that the amount of damages is uncertain or disputed, however, does not bar an award of prejudgment interest. As we recently explained in Estate of Fleming v. Nicholson, 168 Vt. 495, 500, 724 A.2d 1026, 1029 (1998): “Even if the damages [are] not readily ascertainable,. . . the trial court maintains the ability to award prejudgment interest in a discretionary capacity to avoid injustice.”\\nHere, the court properly concluded that Liberty was not entitled to prejudgment interest as a matter of right, the amount of restitution damages having been the subject of considerable uncertainty and dispute. The court failed, however, to consider whether Liberty should be awarded prejudgment interest as a discretionary matter based upon Liberty’s claim that it was wrongfully denied the use of the money during the period in question, and required prejudgment interest to be made whole. Accordingly, the matter must be remanded for further proceedings on this issue.\\nContinental’s Claims\\nIn its cross-appeal, Continental contends the court erred in rejecting its affirmative defenses of waiver, unclean hands, and laches to Liberty’s cross-claim for restitution. Relying on Jefferson Insurance Co. v. Travelers Insurance Co., 159 Vt. 46, 614 A.2d 385 (1992), Continental contends Liberty waived its right to seek restitution by failing to reserve its right in the settlement agreements with Tamarack and the State. In Jefferson, we approved the rule “that when, ivith knowledge of facts that would place liability for a loss on another insurer, an insurer negotiates and settles a claim against its insured without expressly reserving rights to pursue a cause of action for contribution, indemnity or subrogation at a later time, such a claim is waived.” Id. at 50, 614 A.2d at 388 (emphasis added). As the court here found, however, Liberty entered the settlement agreement with the State and Tamarack under the belief that it was the only insurer, which plainly distinguishes this case from Jefferson.\\nContinental also contends that Liberty forfeited any claims against Continental as the subrogee of its insured, Tamarack, as a result of Liberty’s unfair dealings with Tamarack. See Norfolk & Dedham Fire Ins. Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 132 Vt. 341, 346, 318 A.2d 659, 662 (1974) (subrogee must have clear equity and subrogation may be defeated by countervailing equities). The trial court found, however, that the settlement negotiations among Liberty, Tamarack, and the State “were conducted fairly,” that Liberty’s subsequent denial of further benefits after discovering Continental’s potential liability was “reasonable under the circumstances,” and that Continental had “not established a bad faith breach of fiduciary duty.” These findings and conclusions were supported by credible evidence and therefore may not be disturbed on appeal.\\nNor will we second-guess the court’s finding that all of the parties were under the mistaken belief that Liberty was the only insurer, that Tamarack learned of coverage under Continental’s policies in 1992, and that Liberty did not, therefore, unreasonably sit on its rights in failing to seek restitution against Continental until the filing of its cross-claim in 1993.\\nThat portion of the judgment denying prejudgment interest on the restitution award against Continental is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\\n* Although the State contends the court’s finding that it agreed to pay half of the pre-1991 remediation costs was unsupported by the evidence, we need not reach that issue in light of our disposition of the claim.\"}],\n",

       "[\"Johnson, J.\\nThis case concerns a dispute among the parties and their insurers over the allocation of costs for the cleanup of a series of gasoline leaks. The superior court ruled that Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty) was responsible for approximately 92% of the costs, that the Continental/Glens Falls Insurance Company (Continental) was responsible for the balance, and that Liberty’s counterclaim against the State of Vermont for contribution was without merit. Liberty appeals, contending the court erred in: (1) dismissing its counterclaim against the State; (2) making certain findings concerning the amount of petroleum released and the allocation of remediation costs among the parties; (3) ordering a setoff against Liberty’s restitution award from Continental; and (4) declining to award prejudgment interest. Continental has cross-appealed, contending the court erred in rejecting its defenses of waiver, unclean hands, and laches against Liberty’s cross-claim for restitution. We reverse and remand on the issue of prejudgment interest, and otherwise affirm.\\nFACTS\\nAs found by the trial court, the facts were as follows. In 1983, gasoline began to leak from underground storage tanks at Spillane’s Service Center on Route 7 in Shelburne, a site owned by Tamarack Services of South Burlington. The leak was discovered in 1985, and shortly thereafter the State ordered corrective action.\\nThe volume of the release was large. Free-product gasoline spread thoughout the site and migrated to adjacent properties. Liberty, Tamarack’s insurer at the time of the leak, was notified of the release and accepted responsibility for payment of the costs of remediation. Tamarack hired Ground Water Technologies, Inc. (GTI) to monitor contamination levels and perform the cleanup.\\nLiberty’s policy expired in August 1986, at which time Continental became the insurer. Continental’s policy, which was renewed in 1987 and 1988, contained several pollution exclusion endorsements. Liberty continued to pay the costs of remediation through this period.\\nIn November 1987, GTI discovered a second release of gasoline at the site consisting of several leaking fuel lines. These were repaired by January 1988. During the summer of 1989, more leaks occurred. The parties presented a variety of expert evidence and opinion at trial relating to the rate, duration, and overall volume of the three releases. The court found that the initial release, which Continental’s expert had characterized as “massive,” consisted of 11,000 gallons. The court found that the second and third releases, which were much smaller and were discovered relatively quickly through GTI’s previously installed monitoring equipment, each consisted of 450 gallons.\\nTamarack made no claims under its policies with Continental at the time of the second and third releases, believing that the pollution exclusion clauses precluded coverage. Liberty received actual notice of the third release no later than September 1989, and continued to pay remediation costs until 1990, when it requested that GTI provide an estimate of the remediation costs attributable to releases other than the first release. GTI estimated that approximately $89,291 of the $1,103,587 expended to date could be attributed to the later releases.\\nIn September 1990, Liberty suspended payments pending negotations with Tamarack and the State regarding allocation of remediation costs. In October, an agreement was reached in which Tamarack agreed to apply to the State’s petroleum cleanup fund under 10 V.S.A. § 1941, which authorizes the Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources to disburse funds for “uninsured costs” of cleanup and restoration of contaminated soil caused by releases of petroleum from underground storage tanks. 10 V.S.A. § 1941(b). Tamarack represented that it was uninsured for the costs of remediating the 1987 and 1989 releases because of the pollution exclusion clauses in its policies with Continental. Following the authorization of payments from the cleanup fund, Liberty agreed to split the costs of future remediation with the State, and the State agreed to pay 50% of past expenses it determined to be reasonable. Negotiations were not successful over what past costs were reasonable.\\nLater, the State discovered evidence that the pollution exclusion clauses in the Continental policies were invalid because Continental had not obtained timely approval of the clauses from the Department of Insurance. The State thereupon commenced this litigation by filing a complaint against Tamarack, Continental, and Liberty to declare Continental liable under its policies for the 1987 and 1989 releases and to recover the remediation costs paid by the State. Liberty filed a counterclaim against the State on the theory that the State was obligated under the agreement to pay for past expenses allocable to the 1987 and 1989 releases. As the subrogee of Tamarack’s rights, Liberty also filed a cross-claim against Continental, seeking reimbursement of past expenses allocable to the 1987 and 1989 releases. Continental asserted certain affirmative defenses against Liberty’s cross-claim, and filed a cross-claim against Liberty alleging various causes of action.\\nContinental subsequently entered into a settlement agreement with Tamarack and the State, in which it agreed to pay $150,000 for past remediation expenses, and to assume responsibility for the State’s half of future remediation costs. Continental reserved its right to seek monetary or injunctive relief against Liberty.\\nThe trial court subsequently granted partial summary judgment in favor of the State, ruling that the pollution exclusion clauses in the Continental insurance policies were invalid and that insurance coverage was therefore available to Tamarack under those policies for the cost of remediating the 1987 and 1989 releases. Later, the court granted the State’s motion to dismiss Liberty’s counterclaim, ruling that the Secretary was authorized to approve expenditures from the fund only for uninsured cleanup costs.\\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court issued a lengthy written decision, which it subsequently amended, containing extensive and detailed factual findings and conclusions. The court found that there was a “linear relationship” between the total volume of petroleum spilled during the several releases and the total cost of remediation incurred by Liberty and Continental, and calculated the parties’ proportional share of liability based upon the percentage of the total spill (11,900 gallons) attributable to the initial release (11,000 gallons) and subsequent releases (900 gallons). In this fashion, the court determined that 7.563% of past and future remediation costs was Continental’s responsibility and 92.437% was Liberty’s responsibility. Applying these percentages to the total costs of remediation ($2,505,964), the court found that Liberty was entitled to restitution from Continental in the amount of $189,526.05. Having previously paid $189,718.01 toward remediation of the site, Continental was entitled to a credit and refund of $191.96 from Liberty. The court ruled against Continental on its cross-claim against Liberty. This appeal followed.\\nDISCUSSION\\nCounterclaim Against State\\nLiberty contends the court erred in dismissing its counterclaim against the State for enforcement of the State’s agreement to pay 50% of the reasonable remediation costs paid by Liberty between November 1987 and December 31, 1990.\\n*\\nLiberty also contends the court’s order requiring Liberty and Continental to split the future costs of remediation conflicted with Liberty’s agreement with the State.\\nThe statute authorizing state expenditures for petroleum cleanup is clear and unambiguous.

Thus, the court correctly concluded that there was no authority for the State’s expenditure of cleanup funds in this case, and properly dismissed Liberty’s counterclaim.\\nLiberty contends, nevertheless, that Tamarack was somehow uninsured at the time the State authorized the expenditures, and only later became insured when the court ruled that Continental’s pollution-exclusion clauses were invalid. The court’s judgment did not create the insurance coverage, however, but merely declared the existence of coverage under the policies. See 12 V.S.A. § 4711 (courts have power “to declare rights, status and other legal relations”); Robtoy v. City of St. Albans, 132 Vt. 503, 504, 321 A.2d 45, 46 (1974) (function of declaratory judgment is to provide declaration of rights, status and other legal relations). The order dismissing Liberty’s counterclaim against the State, and the order requiring Liberty and Continental to split the future costs of remediation, were therefore proper.\\nSufficiency of the Evidence\\nLiberty next contends the evidence failed to support the court’s findings concerning the volume of the petroleum releases, the total cost of remediation of the Tamarack site, the restitution percentages attributable to Liberty and Continental, and the calculation of the restitution award.\\nThe standard of review is well settled. We will not set aside a trial court’s findings unless clearly erroneous, nor disturb its conclusions if they are reasonably supported by the findings. See Morgan v. Kroupa, 167 Vt. 99, 104, 702 A.2d 630, 633 (1997). Findings are viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, disregarding modifying evidence, and will not be disturbed merely because they are contradicted by substantial evidence; rather, an appellant must show that there is no credible evidence to support the finding. See Bianchi v. Lorenz, 166 Vt. 555, 562, 701 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1997).\\nLiberty contends the evidence failed to support the court’s finding that the volume of the initial 1985 release of petroleum was 11,000 gallons. Continental’s expert testified that the first release was “massive,” and using a variety of methodologies calculated that the volume ranged variously from seven to twenty-seven thousand gallons, “in the tens of thousands of gallons,” “something over 11,000 gallons,” and “10,000 gallons or greater.” These estimates were based, in part, upon evidence indicating both the daily rate of leakage, and the duration of the leak. Credible evidence thus supported the court’s decision to fix the volume at a relatively conservative 11,000 gallons.\\nLiberty further contends the evidence failed to support the court’s finding that the volume of the 1987 release was 450 gallons. The record, however, contains a GTI report, prepared at Liberty’s request, calculating that the second release was between 300 and 600 gallons. The court’s decision to fix the volume at the mid-point was not unreasonable. Although Liberty contends the report’s author was not qualified as an expert, Liberty raised no objection to the report on this or any other ground at trial. Accordingly, the claim is waived on appeal. See State v. Fisher, 167 Vt. 36, 43, 702 A.2d 41, 45-46 (1997) (failure to raise objection at trial waives claim of error on appeal). Liberty also argues that the estimate of 300 to 600 gallons in the GTI report referred to a different release of petroleum, but testimony at trial refuted the contention. The evidence thus supported the finding.\\nLiberty next challenges the court’s finding that the volume of the 1989 release was 450 gallons, asserting that evidence relating to the rate and duration of leakage required a finding of at least 1560 gallons. There was evidence, however, indicating that the third release consisted of three separate leaks of approximately one gallon per day, between April and August of 1989, yielding a total volume of approximately 450 gallons. The fact that there was conflicting evidence does not render the court’s finding unreasonable or clearly erroneous. See Bianchi, 166 Vt. at 562, 701 A.2d at 1041.\\nFinally, the record contains ample evidence to support the court’s finding that the total cost of remediation, including the amounts paid by Liberty and Continental, was $2,505,964.\\nAllocation of Costs and Restitution\\nLiberty next takes issue with the court’s allocation of proportional responsibility for the costs of remediation, which resulted in a finding that Liberty was hable for 92.437% of the costs of remediation, and Continental was responsible for 7.563%. As noted, the liability percentages derived by the court were based upon the respective percentages of the total release of petroleum attributable to the initial and subsequent petroleum releases. The court’s calculations flowed logically from its reasoning and findings, which were based in turn upon credible evidence; they cannot, therefore, be disturbed. See id. Nor did the court clearly err, as Liberty contends, in failing to make a separate restitution award of $39,291.50 based upon GTI’s estimate of the costs attributable to the 1987 and 1989 releases which Liberty paid prior to 1991. The trial court, as noted, found that Liberty was entitled to a total restitution award of $189,526, which plainly included the $39,291 in costs calculated by GTI. There was no error.\\nLiberty also contends the court erred in ordering that the $189,718 paid by Continental toward remediation of the site, pursuant to its settlement with the State, be set off against Liberty’s restitution award of $189,526. The setoff, however, was entirely consistent with the court’s finding concerning the respective liabilities of Liberty and Continental. The fact that the court rejected Continental’s cross-claims against Liberty did not undermine the court’s broad authority to award the setoff. See Jensvold v. Town & Country Motors, Inc., 162 Vt. 580, 584, 649 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1994) (court has broad discretion to award setoff under general equitable principles). Moreover, in its settlement with the State, Continental expressly reserved its right to seek reimbursement from Liberty. Accordingly, we find no error.\\nDiscovery Sanction\\nContinental moved for sanctions against Liberty for failing to produce documents that Continental had requested concerning Liberty’s settlement of third-party claims against Tamarack for a total of $396,692. Following a hearing, the court granted the motion, ruling that Liberty would be precluded from introducing evidence relating to its cross-claim against Continental for restitution of ’the monies paid in settlement of the third-party claims.\\nLiberty’s argument on this point is brief, and consists of the assertion that there is “nothing in the record to suggest that Liberty violated any rules relating to discovery,” and hence no basis for the sanction. The record shows that following an evidentiary hearing and extensive argument, the court concluded that Liberty had failed to respond adequately to Continental’s request for the files relating to the dozen or more third-party claims against Tamarack. In September 1993, and again in October 1995, Continental had requested copies of the complaints and settlement agreements. Continental sought the documents in connection with Liberty’s claim for reimbursement of the costs of settlement associated with the second and third releases. Liberty provided none of the requested documents until trial in March 1997, when it produced one of the files that it claimed to have just discovered. Liberty’s counsel asserted that it had been unable to locate the balance. The court concluded that Liberty had not adequately complied with the request, and that Continental could not properly defend the claim for reimbursument of the settlement costs without the requested documents. As the court succinctly explained: “ [W]hat I’m going to do is not. receive in evidence the third-party claims. . . . [Continental/Glens Falls] have to see the settlement agreements. They asked for them, they’re entitled to them, and they should have them.”\\nContrary to Liberty’s claim, the record amply supports the court’s ruling. Based on the evidence, the court was entitled to find that Liberty had not been forthcoming in responding to the discovery request, and in concluding that Continental had been severely prejudiced as a result. See Bianchi, 166 Vt. at 562, 701 A.2d at 1041 (findings must be upheld if supported by any credible evidence); see also Refac Int’l, Ltd. v. Hitachi, Ltd., 921 F.2d 1247, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (extent of party’s noncompliance with discovery request supported implicit finding of willful failure to comply). We cannot say that the court’s sanction, in these circumstances, constituted a patent abuse of discretion. See White Current Corp. v. Vermont Elec. Coop., 158 Vt. 216, 223, 609 A.2d 222, 226 (1992) (absent abuse of discretion, trial court’s imposition of discovery sanctions will not be disturbed). Accordingly, the court’s ruling must be upheld.\\nLiberty raises the additional claim in its reply brief that the discovery sanction was not predicated upon a specific order compelling production under V.R.C.E 37(b)(2). Liberty did not raise this argument at trial, or in its opening brief, and therefore has waived the claim on appeal. See Long v. L'Esperance, 166 Vt. 566, 570 n.4, 701 A.2d 1048, 1052 n.4 (1997) (preservation at trial); Secretary v. Earth Constr., Inc., 165 Vt. 160, 165, 676 A.2d 769, 773 (1996) (preservation in appellant’s original brief).\\nPrejudgment Interest\\nThe court initially awarded prejudgment interest on Liberty’s restitution award, but reversed itself in response to Continental’s motion for reconsideration, concluding that prejudgment interest was unavailable because the amount of damages was in dispute and the subject of conflicting expert testimony. We have explained the rule on prejudgment interest as follows: “Prejudgment interest may be awarded as damages for detention of money due for breach or default. This interest is awarded as of right when the principal sum recovered is liquidated or capable of ready ascertainment and may be awarded in the court’s discretion for other forms of damage.” Newport Sand & Gravel Co. v. Miller Concrete Constr., Inc., 159 Vt. 66, 71, 614 A.2d 395, 398 (1992).\\nThe principal rationale for an award of prejudment interest as of right is that, where damages are liquidated or determinable by a reasonably certain standard of measurement, “the defendant can avoid the accrual of interest by simply tendering to the plaintiff a sum equal to the amount of damages.” Johnson v. Pearson Agri-Sys., Inc., 350 N.W.2d 127, 130 (Wis. 1984). The fact that the amount of damages is uncertain or disputed, however, does not bar an award of prejudgment interest. As we recently explained in Estate of Fleming v. Nicholson, 168 Vt. 495, 500, 724 A.2d 1026, 1029 (1998): “Even if the damages [are] not readily ascertainable,. . . the trial court maintains the ability to award prejudgment interest in a discretionary capacity to avoid injustice.”\\nHere, the court properly concluded that Liberty was not entitled to prejudgment interest as a matter of right, the amount of restitution damages having been the subject of considerable uncertainty and dispute. The court failed, however, to consider whether Liberty should be awarded prejudgment interest as a discretionary matter based upon Liberty’s claim that it was wrongfully denied the use of the money during the period in question, and required prejudgment interest to be made whole. Accordingly, the matter must be remanded for further proceedings on this issue.\\nContinental’s Claims\\nIn its cross-appeal, Continental contends the court erred in rejecting its affirmative defenses of waiver, unclean hands, and laches to Liberty’s cross-claim for restitution. Relying on Jefferson Insurance Co. v. Travelers Insurance Co., 159 Vt. 46, 614 A.2d 385 (1992), Continental contends Liberty waived its right to seek restitution by failing to reserve its right in the settlement agreements with Tamarack and the State. In Jefferson, we approved the rule “that when, ivith knowledge of facts that would place liability for a loss on another insurer, an insurer negotiates and settles a claim against its insured without expressly reserving rights to pursue a cause of action for contribution, indemnity or subrogation at a later time, such a claim is waived.” Id. at 50, 614 A.2d at 388 (emphasis added). As the court here found, however, Liberty entered the settlement agreement with the State and Tamarack under the belief that it was the only insurer, which plainly distinguishes this case from Jefferson.\\nContinental also contends that Liberty forfeited any claims against Continental as the subrogee of its insured, Tamarack, as a result of Liberty’s unfair dealings with Tamarack. See Norfolk & Dedham Fire Ins. Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 132 Vt. 341, 346, 318 A.2d 659, 662 (1974) (subrogee must have clear equity and subrogation may be defeated by countervailing equities). The trial court found, however, that the settlement negotiations among Liberty, Tamarack, and the State “were conducted fairly,” that Liberty’s subsequent denial of further benefits after discovering Continental’s potential liability was “reasonable under the circumstances,” and that Continental had “not established a bad faith breach of fiduciary duty.” These findings and conclusions were supported by credible evidence and therefore may not be disturbed on appeal.\\nNor will we second-guess the court’s finding that all of the parties were under the mistaken belief that Liberty was the only insurer, that Tamarack learned of coverage under Continental’s policies in 1992, and that Liberty did not, therefore, unreasonably sit on its rights in failing to seek restitution against Continental until the filing of its cross-claim in 1993.\\nThat portion of the judgment denying prejudgment interest on the restitution award against Continental is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\\n* Although the State contends the court’s finding that it agreed to pay half of the pre-1991 remediation costs was unsupported by the evidence, we need not reach that issue in light of our disposition of the claim.\"]"
